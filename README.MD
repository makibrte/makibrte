# About me
I'm a Ph.D. student at Michigan State University. My research is mainly focused on machine learning on soil microbiomes and metagenomics. Also in my free time I pursue software engineering projects. My machine/deep learning wand is PyTorch, backend hammer is Django and front-end I hate/love NextJS. 

## Current research
- Relationship between soil health and it's microbiome
- Metagenomics (cooking in silence)
- NASA LEADS: Drones and lasers
